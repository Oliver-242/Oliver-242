# Jizhou Cai  
> **As an *grade 2020* undergraduate of Huazhong University of Science and Technology, I decide to share my course materials with you to help younger students save valuable time on HUST's ~~bullshit~~ courses. My repositories is classified by different courses, containing those courses I think are totally wasting time due to everyone having its own interests(lots of experiments are mandatory:+1:). These materials only include some courses, but I hope they can help you, my dear *HUSTERS*.**
